# Godot4_p5
Godot4_p5 is an interpretation of  p5.js for Godot, for creative coding

#	Godot Doc : class CanvasItem

# p5js : https://p5js.org

Godot4_p5 is based on p5js’s original goals, but I didn’t tie to p5js’s syntax. Some things are the same (like the setup() and createCanvas() functions), but other things are very different.
I think that creative coding is a great way to practice the fundamentals of coding, which you can then apply to whatever you want.

# Status
I have made some progress on the project, but it's still work in progress. It miss some core function like push/pop .. some part of the drawing function need to be fix/rewrite too.
If you try it, hope you enjoy and give some feedback  :)
